#This script reports the following specs about your PC:
# -How much space is available on each hard disk drive
# -How much space is used/available on each mounted partition
# -How much memory is available on each RAM device
# -How fast is each CPU core (single core machines only have 1 entry)
# -The name, driver used and memory available from your graphics accelerator

#Some of the commands in this script require root privelages, so
#it will display an error if you try to run it as a normal user.
